[id1] hello, I like the course. It really helped me with understanding world history and gave me an insight into how complicated life really was back then in earlier ages.

[id2] I am struggling with the lecture slides. I fould that they were too busy and I switched off.

[id3] No. I think the slides are OK but I dont like all the assignments. I think ther were too many for the short semester period. And they were too long.

[id1] I am learning a lot and it is presented easily for me. Yes there was too much needed for the wrtitten assignments. But even so, it did make me work hard to learn about the different periods of history. I think it paid off.

[id3] yes, I am learning a lot as well. It's a good course overall

[id1] yes I agree, it will be good for my career at the museum.

[id2] Hmm, I will ask the tutor for more help as I am really struggling.
